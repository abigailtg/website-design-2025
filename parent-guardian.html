    <h2>How to Enrol</h2>
    <p>Enrolling at MCAST is a structured process designed to guide students into the course that best suits their qualifications and interests. Applications are submitted online during the official application period, where students select their preferred courses and upload the required documentation, such as identification and academic certificates. Some courses may also require interviews, aptitude tests, or portfolio submissions. Once offers are issued, students must confirm their place within the given timeframe to secure enrolment.</p>

These include application opening and closing dates, enrolment confirmation periods, semester start dates, examination sessions, and academic holidays. Keeping track of these dates helps ensure students remain on schedule and do not miss important milestones that could affect their studies.</p>
